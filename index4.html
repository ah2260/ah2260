	 <h1>"As We May Think" and "Long Live the Web"</h1>
<p> I found “As We May Think,” by Vannevar Bush, to be an incredibly interesting take on how we organize information. While our technology has advanced significantly recently, our means of organizing information has not changed. Currently, we have a system where we gather large amounts of data and linking connections. However, this way is very inefficient and can be a very tedious task. Instead of our current approach, Bush proposes a memex-a piece of technology that finds connections between information and allows them to be shared.
